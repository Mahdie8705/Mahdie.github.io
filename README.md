** An Introduction to my selected dataset**

I selected NYC Taxi data because it is related to transportation planning, and I want to learn more about this gathered dataset. 
This dataset gives us a great visual track of each taxi driver’s driven route during a specific day. 
The most important variables of this database is the number of passengers and the fare amount. 
There is a two-axis chart showing the amount of fare in each hour (y= fares, and x=hour of day). 
By delving into this chart we can make precious information of it, and come up with some policies to better control the traffic, and set some fare policies to make the most profit out of our transportation system. 
For instance, for a taxi driver, the amount of rate is very low or even zero before 8 AM, and it has an ascending inclination till 2 PM; after a short stop (maybe for a rest) the fare amount starts to increase till 5 PM, and after a three-hour stop, the taxi trips are started. 
Additionally, by tracking the driven routes, we can extract good information on the relationship between time of day, and busy spots; this information can definitely be useful for traffic controlling strategies, special events like accidents, and even emission inventory control policies regarding the environmental concerns. 
For example, this driver had the most amount of fares, and the most amount of trips during 8 – 9 PM in the downtown. We can make a lot of information by assessing the neighboring land uses, to see the interaction between these variables.

**An Introduction to my seslected book**

“ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis” written by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen. 
ggplot2 is a great and user friendly package in R used for data visualization. 
This package provides us with great visualization functions to plot our data with colors and shape, so that we can interpret the dataset properly, and take the most accurate results and conclusions out of it. 
For example, I used to utilize ggplot functions for plotting each cluster in a Clustering Analysis, and it’s more efficient than other plotting packages. 
I just want to learn more about it, because it is much related to my work.
